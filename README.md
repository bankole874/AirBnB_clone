##  🦾 What to learn
The AirBnB clone project starts now until… the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/m8g02HcD2ovrl_K-zulYBw).

You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:
A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects)
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).

##  🧑‍💻 Final Product

## ⚽️ Console

The console
- create our data model
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from our console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI we will build later, we won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how our objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow us to change the type of storage easily without updating all of our codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine.

## 🏀 Web static
Now that we have a command interpreter for managing our AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything
During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.
